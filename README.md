Update 1: 
Followed basic switch statement of tutorial, created method to distinguish win scenario. 
Result is "Win" regardless. 

Update 2: 
Scrapped provided code, kept methodology. Disected into 3 main components. 
PlayerInput
EnemyInput 
Program

Switch statement is repeated twice. Next goal to implement a "Switch" class? 
Both Input classes can derive their move from that.
